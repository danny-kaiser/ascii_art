# ascii_art

Notes for development:

I'll want to use a monospaced font like Courier
I'm going to want to automatically plug the output text into a place that automatically displays it properly. From there I'm going to want to look into cutting videos into frames that I feed into this code. I'll want to feed the resultant text into images that I feed into a gif. Shouldn't be too crazy hard. From there I could whip up a lil UI for funsies.
